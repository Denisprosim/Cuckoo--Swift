# Cuckoo-Swift
A cross platform chat-app. Client is communicating via our REST API (source code: https://github.com/BeSuHexis/Cuckoo).
In this particular repository I made iOS client-side app, where you could chat with predefined contact. In the end I got stuck on NOTIFICATION and auto-reload feature.
