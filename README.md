# Cuckoo-Swift
This is my high school project. The goal was to make a cross platform communicating app working entirely on our platform. We made REST API running on my old pc, which provided backend communication with MySQL database. 
In this particular repository I made client-side app, where you could chat with predefined contact. In the end I got stuck on NOTIFICATION and auto-reload feature.
