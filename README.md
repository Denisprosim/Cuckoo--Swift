# Cuckoo-Swift
A cross platform communicating app working entirely on our platform. We made REST API (source code: https://github.com/BeSuHexis/Cuckoo) running on my old pc, which provided backend communication with MySQL database. 
In this particular repository I made iOS client-side app, where you could chat with predefined contact. In the end I got stuck on NOTIFICATION and auto-reload feature.
